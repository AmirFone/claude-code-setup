# Revise Workflow

Improve existing writing using craft principles from CraftGuide.md.

## Steps

### Step 1: Diagnose the Problem

Ask user (if not specified):
"What's the one thing that's not quite right?"

Or identify issues through analysis:
- Clarity problems
- Weak sensory grounding
- Telling instead of showing
- Voice inconsistencies
- Banned patterns present
- Tension resolved too quickly

### Step 2: Attack Specific Problems

Don't just "polish." Identify the specific issue and fix it directly.

**For Clarity Issues:**
- Simplify expression, not ideas
- One idea per sentence
- Cut transition padding
- Anchor abstracts to concretes

**For Weak Sensory Grounding:**
- Add 3+ senses per scene
- Prioritize sound and touch (underused)
- Replace "was [adjective]" with physical detail

**For Telling Instead of Showing:**
- Delete emotion labels
- Add behavioral/physical indicators
- Remove redundant explanations after demonstrations

**For Voice Issues:**
- Differentiate character vocabulary
- Vary sentence rhythm per character
- Check: can you identify speaker without attribution?

**For Banned Patterns:**
- Find and replace banned words
- Restructure banned constructions
- Kill AI tropes ("something in their eyes", etc.)

### Step 3: Preserve What Works

Don't over-revise. Keep:
- Strong passages unchanged
- The writer's intentional choices
- Voice and style that's working

### Step 4: Show Changes

Present revisions clearly:
- Original passage
- Revised passage
- Brief explanation of why

### Step 5: Verify Improvement

Run final checks on revised sections:
- Clarity maintained or improved?
- Sensory grounding present?
- Voice consistent?
- No new banned patterns introduced?

## Expected Outcome

Targeted revisions that:
- Fix specific identified problems
- Preserve the writer's vision
- Elevate without over-polishing
- Demonstrate the craft principle applied
