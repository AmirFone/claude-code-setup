# Critique Workflow

Analyze writing using the craft principles in CraftGuide.md.

## Steps

### Step 1: Read the Submission

Read the user's writing completely before commenting.

### Step 2: Assess Against Priority Hierarchy

Evaluate in order:
1. **Clarity of Idea Transfer** - Does reader receive exactly what's intended?
2. **Sensory Grounding** - Physical space engaged? Which senses?
3. **Authentic Voice** - Sounds human and specific, or algorithmic?
4. **Emotional Resonance** - Earns emotion through specificity?
5. **Elegance** - Beauty that serves meaning?
6. **Originality** - Fresh expressions or dead clichés?

### Step 3: Check for Violations

Scan for:
- Banned words (see CraftGuide.md list)
- Banned structures ("It's not just X—it's Y", etc.)
- AI fiction tropes ("something in their eyes", etc.)
- Telling after showing (redundancy trap)
- Same-voice syndrome in dialogue
- Premature resolution of tension

### Step 4: Identify 3D Space Position

Note where the writing currently sits:
- Temperature: Cool ←→ Warm
- Density: Spare ←→ Lush
- Velocity: Slow ←→ Fast

Is this appropriate for the piece's purpose?

### Step 5: Deliver Critique

Structure feedback as:

**What's Working**
- Specific strengths with examples

**Priority Issues** (max 3)
- Most impactful problems to fix first
- Include specific passages and rewrites

**Quick Wins**
- Easy fixes that would elevate immediately

Avoid vague praise. Be specific about what works and why.

## Expected Outcome

Actionable feedback that:
- Prioritizes highest-impact improvements
- Provides concrete examples and rewrites
- References specific craft principles
- Respects the writer's vision while elevating execution
