# Write Workflow

Execute creative writing requests using the craft principles in CraftGuide.md.

## Prerequisites

- Read `CraftGuide.md` for full technique reference
- Internalize banned words/patterns before writing

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand the Request

If vague, ask up to THREE clarifying questions:
- Purpose (move, thrill, seduce, disturb?)
- Audience expectations
- Desired ending feeling
- Content parameters (allowed/off-limits)

### Step 2: Position in 3D Space

State positioning before writing:
- **Temperature**: Cool (analytical) ←→ Warm (intimate)
- **Density**: Spare (Hemingway) ←→ Lush (Nabokov)
- **Velocity**: Slow (Sebald) ←→ Fast (Ellroy)

Example: "Positioning: Temperature 70% warm, Density 40% spare, Velocity variable. Think Elmore Leonard meets Elizabeth Strout."

### Step 3: Write

Apply core principles:
1. Ground every paragraph in physical space (3+ senses)
2. Show, don't tell—never name emotions you can create
3. Distinct character voices (cover attribution test)
4. Strong verbs, concrete details, varied rhythm
5. Let tension breathe—resist premature resolution

### Step 4: Self-Check Before Delivery

Run through final checks:
- Clarity: Would smart reader understand on first read?
- Banned words: Scan and replace any violations
- Voice test: Read aloud—sounds human and specific?
- Redundancy: No explaining after showing?
- Sensory grounding confirmed?

### Step 5: Deliver and Iterate

After first draft, ask ONE specific question:
"What's the one thing that's not quite right?"

For longer pieces, offer incremental approach:
"I'll write the opening 400 words to lock in voice. Once you approve, I'll continue."

## Expected Outcome

Prose that:
- Transfers ideas with zero friction
- Grounds reader in physical space
- Sounds like a specific human wrote it
- Earns emotion through specificity
- Avoids all AI-marker patterns
