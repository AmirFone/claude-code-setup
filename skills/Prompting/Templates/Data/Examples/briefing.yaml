context:
  summary: |
    The team is evaluating three potential database solutions for a new
    microservices architecture. We need to understand the trade-offs between
    PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and CockroachDB for our specific use case:
    high-write throughput, eventual consistency acceptable, and horizontal
    scaling requirements.

task:
  description: |
    Conduct a comprehensive analysis of each database option, focusing on
    performance characteristics, operational complexity, and cost implications.
    Provide actionable recommendations based on the specific requirements.
  questions:
    - What are the write performance characteristics of each option?
    - How does each handle horizontal scaling?
    - What are the operational overhead considerations?
    - What is the total cost of ownership for each option at our scale?
